<samp><b>Baldur's Gate III Mod Collection</b></samp>

<samp><b>[Companion Camp Outfits](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/18302)</b></samp>

Provides camp outfit options for companions, including initial camp outfits and epilogue camp outfits. These can be found in the Tutorial Chest.

When using the Tutorial Chest to obtain camp outfits, only pick up the clothing items themselves. If you have mod backpacks in your inventory or storage when uninstalling the mod, it may cause the game to crash.

<samp><b>[Companions Always Approval](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/18301)</b></samp>

Automatically restores companion approval ratings when they drop, allowing you to experiment with different dialogue choices and actions without worrying about permanently damaging your relationships. Feel free to try those "interesting" options that might normally upset your companions.

<samp><b>[Enemy of Justice Fxxkoff](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/18300)</b></samp>

Automatically removes the "Enemy of Justice" status effect, which is an annoying and unsolvable debuff that can ruin your gameplay experience. This mod automatically removes this status both when you acquire it and when the game starts, ensuring you never have to deal with this frustrating mechanic.
